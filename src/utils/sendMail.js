Dear HR Team,

Hope you're doing well. I’m reaching out regarding the ${designation} role at ${companyName}, as I noticed the team is currently hiring. With 2.5+ years of hands-on experience building production-grade applications using React, Next.js, Redux, and modern backend stacks such as node.js, nestjs, SQL/NoSQL, I believe I’d be a strong fit.

I’ve recently delivered high-impact features at Antino Labs and previously at Insoftlink, where I improved system performance, enhanced user experience, and contributed directly to product growth. I’m now looking to bring the same execution, ownership, and problem-solving mindset to a fast-moving engineering team.

Since your team is actively expanding, I’d love to explore how I can contribute. I’m attaching my resume for your reference.

Thank you for your time—looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Mohit Singh Rawat
